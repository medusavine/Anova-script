#Using ANOVA
#the data set you will use is one from a field experiment designed to investigate the effect of genetic diversity on the productivity of eel grass 
#(this is from Whitlock and Schulter's excellent statistics textbook, the Analysis of Biological Data. Individual plants were randomly assigned to plots and there were three types of plots: 
#one with only a single genotype of plant (all plants in the plot genetically identical), one with three different genotypes, and one with 6 different genotypes. After a period of time, the numbers of shoots per plot were recorded. The data are in EelgrassGenotypes.csv

#construct a new R script (without cutting and pasting) that uses an ANOVA to test for differences in means and then summarize the data in a bar plot. Ask for help if you need it.
#In Class ANOVA Script

#import the CSV file
eelgrass <- read.csv(file = "C:/Users/butte/OneDrive/Desktop/BIO 1010 Scripts/In Class/EelgrassGenotypes.csv")
eelgrass

#identify the predictor and response variables
predictor <-eelgrass$treatmentGenotypes
response <-eelgrass$shoots

#then use the ANOVA function  aov(y ~ x) is the ANOVA function
modelgrass <- aov(response ~ predictor)

#look at the results of the ANOVA Function
summary(modelgrass)

#run a Tukey test and put the results into a variable
diffmeansgrass <- TukeyHSD(modelgrass)

#put the differences between groups into the vector
groups <-c("One", "Three", "Six")
statisticalgroup <- c("A", "AB", "B")

#calculate the means and the confidence intervals with a for loop
means<- rep(NA, 3)
ci <- rep(NA, 3)

# Use the index from the groups vector to run the for loop
for (i in 1:3){
  means[i] <-mean(eelgrass$shoots==groups[i])
  sd <- mean(eelgrass$shoots[eelgrass$treatmentGenotypes==groups[i]])
  ci[i] <- 2*sd/sqrt(sum(eelgrass$treatmentGenotypes==groups[i]))
}

#make the barplot using the data
barx <- barplot(means, names=groups, las=1, ylab="Shoots", xlab="Treatment Genotypes", 
                ylim=c(0, 90),width=20, col=c("red"))

#show the standard error in the graph
segments(barx, means - ci, barx, means + ci)

#label the groups
text(barx, 60, statisticalgroup)
